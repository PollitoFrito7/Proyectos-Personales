Better luck next time, champ.
Looks like the house wins again.
Tough break, maybe you should stick to slots.
Too bad, so sad.
What a shame, almost had it.
Guess the cards weren't in your favor.
The house always wins, remember?
Looks like your luck just ran out.
Don't feel bad, it happens to the best of 'em.
Nice try, but not nice enough.
Better keep practicing.
Looks like you should have stopped while you were ahead.
Want some advice? Don't quit your day job.
Ah, the sweet sound of victory.
Another one bites the dust.
You win some, you lose some. Mostly lose.
Better luck next time, if there is a next time.
Looks like I'm on a roll.
That was easy. Try again?
Maybe next time, you'll be the lucky one. Maybe.

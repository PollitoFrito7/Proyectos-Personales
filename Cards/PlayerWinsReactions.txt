Lucky bastard! It wont happen again!
You're pure luck, 0 skill.
Lucky motherfucker!
Bullshit! Are you cheating?
You lucky bastard, you'll run out of that luck eventually. All of you do eventually.
You won't stop playing, right? This may be the beggining of a hot streak.
Fuck, it was fucking close!
Damn...
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
You won, big deal. Want a cookie?
Don't get used to it.
Well, miracles do happen.
One win doesn't make you a pro.
You think you're clever, don't you?
Bet you couldn't do that again if you tried.
Big whoop, let's see you try that again.
